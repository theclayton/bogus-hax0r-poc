  This file can be used along side a variety of proof of concept exploits.

  The original usage was to demonstrate the effects of reflected XSS and
  insecure server configuration vulnerabilities that allowed an attacker to
  perform a click jacking attack by overlaying this page on top of the 
  vulnerable website. The attack was able to bypass a strict Cloudflare WAF 
  by injecting an iframe with a link to this page.
