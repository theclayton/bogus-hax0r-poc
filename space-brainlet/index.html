<!--
  This file can be used along side a variety of proof of concept exploits.

  The original usage was to demonstrate the effects of reflected XSS and
  insecure server configuration vulnerabilities that allowed an attacker to
  perform a click jacking attack by overlaying this page on top of the 
  vulnerable website. At the time, I was able to bypass a Cloudflare WAF by 
  injecting an iframe with a link to this page. 

  Now its just a link for random testing scenarios.

  <p>Dont' worry you weren't actually hacked. This is just a demonstration of you being tricked into clicking a link and
    a possible scenario of malicious code ran on your computer...</p>
